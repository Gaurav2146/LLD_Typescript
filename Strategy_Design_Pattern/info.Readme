1. In strtegy design pattern all the child class have different capabilities due to which we can
   not implement the method in parent class.
2. Multiple child class have features in common so, if we provide implementation directly in child
   class then it will result in code duplicacy.
3. So, we create a strategy interface which will have child classes implementing that strategy and 
   the child class which needs the strategy can directly inject it through constructor injection in the 
   parent calss.
